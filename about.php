<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Hindavi, The Kitchens of History</b> presents a seamless series of events that have influenced 
our lives through cuisine and rituals we enjoy both in the privacy of our homes when we 
entertain and at opulent banquets. History, like food, is often seen from the prism of 
the authors’ perspectives and interests.</br></br>

By ferreting out recorded facts in the public domain, factoring in oral legends, even reconjuring and
 reimagining, the blog aims to animate exciting chapters in Indian history. It visits the intrigue, the 
 kitchen cabinets, the influences brought in by successive waves of migrants (on pursuits ranging from 
 peaceful to aggressive) and gives hobby cooks and modern-day chefs a lot to work with.</br></br>

Our interest is largely farmaishi (secret/ bespoke) cuisine, because India’s culinary tragedy has been 
that this art has been lost either because it perished with the protagonists or was kept under wraps as 
it was handed down exclusively from mothers to their progeny or from cooks to their sons. However the 
centuries-old culture of street food teaches an invaluable lesson: food that is accessible will live on
 while food that is exclusive runs the risk of extinction.</br></br>

The blog also looks to set right some misconceptions. It is sometimes said that India is a wasteland of
derived styles, tastes and presentations; that many of its best dishes came from elsewhere – Iran or 
Central Asia for instance. Hindavi, The Kitchens of History stands with food historians who have shown
that far from being a blank slate, India has since the earliest of times been a fountainhead of tastes
and flavours – playing with and adapting external influences, combining it with existing traditions, 
making it her own.</br></br>

Megasthanes, the Greek diplomat and historian, speaks of Emperor Asoka’s dishes made from peahen and deer. 
Ancient literature tells us the favourite cuisine of a certain mythological princess was pulao with deer 
meat. We know that India’s spices, rice, turmeric, desi ghee, fruits and vegetables have become the 
cornerstone of the cuisine of many nations. For example, turmeric is indispensable to the cuisine of Iran.</br></br>

The ancient craze for pepper underscores the idea that the story of civilization is also the history of  food and cooking, and Indian cooking, now the mainstay in Britain, was perhaps the world’s first international cuisine. In the Roman Empire the celebrity chef Apicius wrote a famous cookbook in which 
350 recipes out of 500 recipes (which included spiced flamingo and curried ostrich) used peppers and 
Southern Indian spices. To read Apicius is to receive the impression that to go to a high class dinner 
party in Ancient Rome was to go all the way to India laden with gold to exchange for pepper and spices.</br></br>

India has given, India has absorbed and India continues to expand the universal imagination. We hope 
that you will contribute in recovering and reimagining the lost flavours of India.</br></br></p>
